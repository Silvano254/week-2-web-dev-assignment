📄 README: HTML5 User Registration Form
🧠 Project Overview
This project is a responsive and accessible HTML5 user registration form designed to demonstrate best practices in semantic markup, form validation, and user experience. It includes a variety of input types and attributes to ensure data integrity, usability, and accessibility.

🚀 Features
✅ Semantic HTML5 Structure Uses <section>, <article>, <fieldset>, <legend>, and <label> for clear, accessible layout.

🧩 Diverse Input Types Includes text, email, password, date, number, radio buttons, checkboxes, file upload, and dropdown select.

🔐 Built-in Validation HTML5 validation features like required, pattern, min, max, and type="email" ensure proper data entry.

🧠 User-Friendly Attributes Implements placeholder, autocomplete, and readonly to enhance user experience.

♿ Accessibility-First Design All form controls are properly labeled, grouped, and structured for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Customize the form fields or styles as needed.

Optionally, connect the form to a backend using PHP, Node.js, or a service like Formspree.

🌍 Accessibility & UX Notes
All inputs have associated <label> elements for screen reader compatibility.

Logical tab order ensures smooth keyboard navigation.
